Added:
  > A text paragraph element that shows each characters stats (Power, Mobility ect)
  > A console message that retrieves the first item in the character's equipment from the manifest

Challenges:
  > Not understanding that the stats were stored as key value pairs
  > Organisation - Struggled to figure out the best place to call the stat method
  > When trying to get the equipment from the character a different component was required
  > To actually get data on the items a manifest had to be fetched
  > Reading the manifest was an issue as it returned pure json and I got stuck trying to read it
